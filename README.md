This project is a REST service using Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

Express routes are used to create a question/answer forum where users can vote the answer up/down (similar to Reddit or Stack Overflow).

Skills I covered through this tutorial are:
-Building a REST Service
-Building API Routes in Express
-Modeling Data for the API
-Communicating with Mongo through Mongoose

I followed a tutorial from Treehouse for this project.
